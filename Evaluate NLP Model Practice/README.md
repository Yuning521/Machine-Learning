# Evaluate NLP Model

The goal of is to evaluate  an existing natural language processing model â€” specifically, the Perspective API released by Google Jigsaw. I examine a sample TEST dataset of internet comments and assess the goodness of the ML model that Perspective API hosts. I am only interested in assessing the performance of the model using the classification metrics.
